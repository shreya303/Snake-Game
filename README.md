# Snake-Game
This is a good basic project for beginners trying to get started with JavaScript, like myself when i made it. Made it for a mini project in SE hope it helps you guys too.! :) 
This snake game ends on crashing the boundaries, the snake body is created using a very logical array concept. There are multiple sounds which can be altered to your liking.
